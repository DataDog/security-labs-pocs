Datadog Security Labs Research and Proof of Concept Code
===

This repository contains information, exploits, malware samples, and scripts from Datadog Security Labs.


## Goal

This repository aims at providing proof of concept exploits, malware samples and technical demos to help the community respond to threats. Code from this repository might be used to:

* Improve Detections
* Continue additional research on Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)
* Discover additional exploits

## Proofs of Concept
