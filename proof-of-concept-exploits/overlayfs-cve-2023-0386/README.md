# CVE-2023-0386

This folder contains a virtual machine and instructions to reproduce [CVE-2023-0386](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0386), a vulnerability in the Linux kernelâ€™s OverlayFS subsystem that allows an unprivileged user to escalate their privileges to root.

## How to reproduce

* Start the virtual machine (based on Ubuntu 22.04.1, kernel 5.15.0-57-generic):

```
vagrant up
```

* SSH to the machine as an unprivileged user:

```
vagrant ssh --command "sudo su john -c 'cd; bash'"
```

```bash
john@ubuntu-jammy:~$ id
uid=1002(john) gid=1002(john) groups=1002(john)
```

* Exploit

The virtual machine is provisioned with an exploit merging the different pieces of this [proof of concept repository](https://github.com/xkaneiki/CVE-2023-0386/) into one single static binary. This binary creates folders tree under `/tmp/ovlcap` and starts FUSE filesystem which serves an suid executable. It then calls `unshare` with mount overlay command and copy of the lower suid executable. Finally, it runs the suid executable to spawn a root shell.

Run the following command to exploit the vulnerability and escalate to root:

```
./poc
```
